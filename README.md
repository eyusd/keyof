Type-safe property paths for Python, inspired by TypeScript's `keyof`.

## What it does

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from keyof import KeyOf

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: str

# Define a path, your IDE autocompletes, your type checker validates
path = KeyOf(lambda u: u.name)

# Extract the value
user = User(name="Alice", email="alice@example.com")
path.from_(user)  # → "Alice"

# Serialize for APIs, configs, logs...
str(path)  # → "name"
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install py-keyof
```

## Why? 🤔

String-based paths like `"user.address.city"` are convenient, but they break silently when you rename a field. Your IDE can't autocomplete them, and typos only surface at runtime (usually in production, at 3am).

`keyof` uses a lambda to capture the path. Pylance/Pyright sees the lambda and validates every attribute access, so you get squiggly red lines in your editor instead of surprises in production.

## How it works (and Python's limitations)

Python doesn't have TypeScript's `keyof` operator, so we get a bit creative:

1. At runtime, the lambda receives a proxy object that records attribute accesses
2. At type-check time, the lambda is analyzed normally by Pylance/Pyright

The path gets validated statically, but the mechanism is admittedly a bit of a hack. The lambda never actually runs on real data, it only runs once during `KeyOf` construction to capture the path.

## Handling optional fields 🔗

When a field is `T | None`, accessing attributes on it is a type error. Use `nn()` to tell the type checker "trust me, this isn't None":

```python
from keyof import KeyOf, nn

@dataclass
class User:
    address: Address | None

# nn() strips None from the type (no-op at runtime)
path = KeyOf(lambda u: nn(u.address).city)

# Or with pipe syntax, if that's more your style
path = KeyOf(lambda u: (u.address | nn).city)
```

This is similar to TypeScript's `!` or Kotlin's `!!`. The path will still fail at runtime if the value is actually None. Use `path.from_(obj, default=...)` to handle that gracefully.

## Working with dicts and lists

Bracket access works too:

```python
data = {"users": [{"name": "Alice"}]}

path = KeyOf(lambda d: d["users"][0]["name"])
path.from_(data)  # → "Alice"
```

## Path introspection 🔍

```python
path = KeyOf(lambda u: u.address.city)

path.parts   # → ("address", "city")
path.depth   # → 2
path.root    # → "address"
path.leaf    # → "city"
path.parent()  # → KeyOf for "address"
```

## Serialization

Need your path in a different format? `keyof` got you covered:

```python
path = KeyOf(lambda u: u.address.city)

str(path)          # → "address.city"
path.to_jsonpath() # → "$.address.city"
path.to_bracket()  # → "['address']['city']"
path.to_posix()                 # → "address/city"
path.to_posix(from_root=True)   # → "/address/city"
path.to_xpath()                 # → "address/city"
path.to_xpath(from_root=True)   # → "/address/city"
```

## Equality and hashing

Paths are immutable and can be compared, hashed, and used in sets/dicts:

```python
p1 = KeyOf(lambda u: u.name)
p2 = KeyOf(lambda u: u.name)

p1 == p2      # True
p1 == "name"  # True (compares string representation)
{p1, p2}      # Set with one element
```

## Limitations ⚠️

- The lambda trick only works for attribute and item access. Method calls, arithmetic, or other expressions won't work.
- Pipe syntax `(x | nn)` needs parentheses because `.` binds tighter than `|`.
- There's no way to express "this path might not exist" at the type level. That's a runtime concern, handled by the `default` parameter.
